# Randomized Algorithms Final project

## Goal
This repo contains the final project for WPI's CS525 Randomized Algorithms.

## Structure
The only file in this repo is ```final_project.py```, which implements the Removal Low Degree Algorithm described in Uriel Feige's and Dorit Ron's, *Finding hidden cliques in linear time*.

The only dependencies of this project are Numpy and Matplotlib.
